# NOTE: The chart you generated in the previous step is setup to run an NGINX server exposed via a Kubernetes Service. By default, the chart will create a ClusterIP type Service, so NGINX will only be exposed internally in the cluster. To access it externally, we’ll use the NodePort type instead. We can also set the name of the Helm release so we can easily refer back to it. Let’s go ahead and deploy our NGINX chart using the helm install command:
service:
  # FIXME: FYI, this is the orig
  # type: ClusterIP
  type: NodePort
  port: 80


ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"

  hosts:
    # - nginx-welcome.hyenaclan.org
    - nginx-welcome.scarlettlab.home
  tls: []
  #  - secretName: chart-example-tls
  #    hosts:
  #      - chart-example.local

resources: {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # limits:
  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
